# Banana Bread

## Baking Time: 65-75 minutes
## Temperature: 350 F

## Ingredients

- 3 medium bananas
- 2 large eggs
- 3/4 cup brown sugar
- 1/2 cup butter (melted)
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon sea salt
- 1 cup chocolate chips
- 1 cup chopped walnuts

## Steps

- Butter a 5"x9" loaf pan.
- Mash the bananas in a large bowl.
- Add the eggs, brown sugar, and melted butter and whisk well.
- In a medium-sized bowl, whisk the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt.
- Gently fold the flour mixture into the banana mixture. When only a few streaks of flour remain, add the chocolate chips and walnuts and fold them into the batter.
- Pour the batter into the loaf pan. Top with a few extra walnuts and chocolate chips, if you'd like.
- Bake for 65-75 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Cleck the loaf after 45 minutes and, if it's browning too quickly, cover the top loosely with foil.
